                              <p>Development of Terraria began in January 2011 by Re-Logic,built on the Microsoft XNA framework and written in C#. Re-Logic was composed of Andrew Spinks, who designed 
                                 and programmed the game; Finn Brice, who, along with Spinks, did the graphic design for the game. The music was composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly. The game was released 
                                 for Windows on May 16, 2011.In December 2011, the game was updated to version 1.1, adding new monsters, bosses, NPCs, and items. The update also included improvements to the game's world 
                                 generation technology and lighting system. In February 2012, the developers announced that they would not continue development but would release a final bug-fix 
                                 patch.However, development resumed in 2013 with Spinks asking the community for ideas to include in future content updates.

                                 values their customers and partners so little. Doing business with Google is a liability."He later clarified that existing Android and Google Play versions of the
                                 game will not be affected.Later that February, Google reached out to Re-Logic about the account shutdown and provided transparency around the situation and restored 
                                 their accounts, and subsequently, Re-Logic reaffirmed that they still planned to release the game for Stadia, which it did on March 18, 2021.
